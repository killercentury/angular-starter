This is an opinionated Angular project starter based on the initial project generated by yeoman. It provides some useful configurations and tools that facilitate the workflow in a real project. This may become a generator in the future once all the essential parts have been included.

List of changes:
* Bootstrap version is fixed to 3.3.4 due to [yeoman/generator-angular#1116](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular/issues/1116).
* Use the "force" option of JSHint to make sure JSHint only report errors but not fail the task.
* Add a CI target for JSHint and produce checkstyle report for CI (Jenkins, etc).
* Install "karma-coverage" and "karma-junit-reporter" and enable it via the "karma.conf.js".
* Add karma targets for Travis and Jenkins.
* Install "protractor" and "grunt-protractor-runner".
* Add an "e2e" subdirectory under the test directory and basic e2e tests inside.
* Add a default protractor config for local development without specified fixed selenium address.
* Add grunt config for protractor.
