# Angular Starter

This is an opinionated Angular project starter based on the initial project generated by yeoman. It provides some useful configurations and tools that facilitate the workflow in a real project.

List of changes:
* Bootstrap version is fixed to 3.3.4 due to [yeoman/generator-angular#1116](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular/issues/1116).
* Use the "force" option of JSHint to make sure JSHint only report errors but not fail the task.
